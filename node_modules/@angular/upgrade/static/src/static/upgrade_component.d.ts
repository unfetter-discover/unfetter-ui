/**
 * @whatItDoes
 *
 * *Part of the [upgrade/static](/docs/ts/latest/api/#!?query=upgrade%2Fstatic)
 * library for hybrid upgrade apps that support AoT compilation*
 *
 * Allows an AngularJS component to be used from Angular.
 *
 * @howToUse
 *
 * Let's assume that you have an AngularJS component called `ng1Hero` that needs
 * to be made available in Angular templates.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="ng1-hero"}
 *
 * We must create a {@link Directive} that will make this AngularJS component
 * available inside Angular templates.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="ng1-hero-wrapper"}
 *
 * In this example you can see that we must derive from the {@link UpgradeComponent}
 * base class but also provide an {@link Directive `@Directive`} decorator. This is
 * because the AoT compiler requires that this information is statically available at
 * compile time.
 *
 * Note that we must do the following:
 * * specify the directive's selector (`ng1-hero`)
 * * specify all inputs and outputs that the AngularJS component expects
 * * derive from `UpgradeComponent`
 * * call the base class from the constructor, passing
 *   * the AngularJS name of the component (`ng1Hero`)
 *   * the {@link ElementRef} and {@link Injector} for the component wrapper
 *
 * @description
 *
 * A helper class that should be used as a base class for creating Angular directives
 * that wrap AngularJS components that need to be "upgraded".
 *

     * already implements them and so does not wire up calls to them at runtime.
