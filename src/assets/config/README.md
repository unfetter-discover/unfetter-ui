This directory is for adding configuration specific to the user's locale, such as a site banner or authentication services, in a `local-settings.json` file. See the `assets/runmode-settings.json` file for what properties and values would go into the file, based on the mode you will be running in.

_This file only exists to ensure the config directory is a part of any deployment, even if there is no local-settings file to be added to the mounted volume._
