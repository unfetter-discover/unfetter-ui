          <span>When the threat hits, cyber security professionals working at the tactical, operational, and 
            strategic levels need to work together quickly and effectively to enable a common cyber security 
            strategy and protect against the adversary. The ability to do this in a repeatable and scalable 
            way depends on an organization's agility to discover gaps in their security posture, 
            understand adversary tradecraft, and communicate defensive courses of action.</span>

            <span class="light">
              The vision for Unfetter is to create a community-driven suite of open source tools that leverage models like MITRE's 
              <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> to help cyber security professionals explore and analyze gaps 
              in their security posture.  This suite of tools provides a way for users to build on insights and make informed decisions based on data driven trade space analysis.

            <span class="light">Our second prototype, <a href="https://www.github.com/iadgov/unfetter-discover/" target="_blank">Unfetter|Discover</a> is aimed at helping the user explore additional gaps across their security posture and experiment with next steps.  The initial focus is on mapping mitigations and security controls to <a href="https://attack.mitre.org" target="_blank">ATT&amp;CK&#8482;</a> and demonstrating how to explore, learn, and communicate between tactical, operational, and strategic levels of operation.
